About
=====

``pbsjob`` is a small script useful in the submission of jobs to clusters
running the PBS scheduler. It was made to submit jobs from a workstation
without being required to remember how to write jobscripts.

Typical use case
================

You keep your shared objects/libraries and helper tools in ``~/someFolder``.
On the login node of your cluster, you have the same tools in
``~/remoteFolder``. You want to run scripts in these folders.

You find yourself copying the script to the cluster, logging into the
cluster, writing a jobscript, submitting the jobscript and logging off
again. This lengthy procedure is shortenend with this script.

Usage
=====

Configuration
-------------

The script reads ``~/pbsjob.dat`` on your local machine. The file shall contain
your username and the URL for the remote machine, the working directory on the
login node as well as a suffix for jobscript filenames. An example is given
here::

  user@machine.domain
  MPIexample
  .jobscript


Submitting scripts
------------------

Type

::
  pbsjob.py --nodes 2 --ppn 8 --name MyName --stdout bla.out
     --stderr bla.err --walltime 2 ./scriptToRun

to submit the file ``./scriptToRun`` to the remote machine given in the
configuration file. The job will use 2 nodes with 8 processes per node,
standard output is written to ``bla.out`` in the working directory, standard
error is written to ``bla.err`` respectively. The walltime will be 2 hours.
The job's name will be "MyName".

If the file "scriptToRun" already exists on the remote, you are asked whether
you want to overwrite the remote file or use the existing file.

The arguments ``--name``, ``--walltime``, ``--stdout`` and ``--stderr`` are
optional. If no name is given, the script's name is used. The walltime defaults
to 800 hours. The output files default to the scriptname suffixed by ".out" and
".err", respectively.

You can get help by typing

::

  ./pbsjob.py --help

Modifications
=============

To use different schedulers, you may want to modify the part of the source
that sets the ``jobscript`` variable. Also, default names and conventions
can be found in the source.
